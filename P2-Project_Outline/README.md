# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions


BAD WITH NAMES

### Overview
Have you ever gone to a multi-day conference to network, or started a new job and suddenly had a brand new cast of people in your every day life?
And one day, you are twenty minutes into a conversation and realize
"Sh*t-- what's their name again...?"

If you're anything like me this can happen for the first, second, fifth, twentieth, and so on time I meet someone. I really want people to think I am interested in them, because I am!, but honestly, I am just really, really bad with names.

That's where my app comes in. It's a flashcard app that you can do in your free time, where you can upload a picture of someone, "write" their name on the back of it, and other pertinent information (like their job title, interests, etc). And train yourself to associate this person's face with a name. 

### Features

Each card can have a photo, name, and description. They need to have at least 2 of those three.

You can save them into collections named "decks".

There will be a user signup.

### Technologies

C#, ASP.Net

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll have to learn how to let users upload photos into an application.

### Project Tracker
I'm not using trello, I'm using a scrum app, but I can't link it as you need to be signed in to see anything.
